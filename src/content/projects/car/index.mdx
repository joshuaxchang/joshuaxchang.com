I installed an early version of the [comma.ai](https://comma.ai/) system on my car. Running [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) allows my 2017 Toyota Prius to have lane keeping function similar to Tesla Autopilot. Some simple modification of the code allows me to control my car with the 4 button keyboard I've built.

Since the early versions of the comma.ai system was a little more cumbersome, I designed a circuit board to hide the electronics and shared it with a few other users.
