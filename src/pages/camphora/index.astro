      <p>Influenced by the COVID-era focus on air quality, I wanted an air quality monitor and an air purifier for myself and my family. The available products didn’t quite suit my needs, so I decided to create my own. This endeavor grew into a startup with two main products: an air quality monitor and a wirelessly linked air purifier.</p>
      <p>My design is guided by these principles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Ease of Use.</strong> My parents should be able to use them without much instruction. No app or web portal is required for primary functions: the air purifier uses a simple physical knob, and the air quality monitor has a large display for clear output. The two products link directly using the ESP-NOW protocol, bypassing the complex WiFi pairing that is a common pain point in many IoT devices. This focus on simplicity extends to advanced users as well; for Home Assistant, the device is auto-discoverable by ESPHome to ensure the integration process is seamless.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Respect for Users.</strong> Many “smart” devices require an app, an account, or a constant internet connection. This means the user never truly “owns” the product, as the company can display ads, sell data, or shut down the service entirely. I designed my products on the opposite principle: their primary functions are self-contained and work entirely offline, requiring no connection to the user's home WiFi. The optional firmware updates are designed to be user-initiated and straightforward.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hackable.</strong> I personally prefer products that I can tinker with, and I want the product I make to be something I would want to buy. While the products are designed to be modifiable, this decision does not overrule the ease of use for non-enthusiasts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transparency.</strong> I learned a lot from others who publish their designs, and I want to share my work in return. The code and schematics are available, and I'm documenting my journey here. My air purifier design is almost entirely 3D printed. Unlike complex open hardware that requires industrial tools, the barrier to entry is extremely low. Knowing this, I'm still offering the files on a "pay what you want" basis for personal use. My priority is getting this design into the hands of people who need it, without cost being a barrier.

      <p>The following pages are my journal of this quest. To an experienced developer or designer, some of the challenges I document might seem trivial. My intent is to show the entire process for those who are curious. It’s a glimpse into the hidden details and care that go into creating a product from scratch.</p>
